        This website was originally a plain markdown GitHub pages site, but in October 2025, I found the occasion to learn React for work. In an attempt to not competely misplace the company's good faith, I decided to practice by converting this portfolio site to React. More specifically, it's running on Vite with TailwindCSS for most styling.

        A lot of the migration was done using Claude Code, another tool I was learning at the time, but I had the ability to go slow and at least learn to be literate: even if I can't write a website from scratch, I can read JavaScript/HTML now, which is very helpful when working with AI tools. The ability to notice when an AI coding agent is going off the rails is the most important thing with AI coding, I think. And that's not to say I learned nothing: now that I understand the setup, I can write and style my own pages using JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind, which is a far cry more than I could do before.

        Have a look around! I hope you like it.
