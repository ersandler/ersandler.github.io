Context is everything. <br>
That's the conclusion I drew from this evolutionary game theory project, where I used neural networks built using TensorFlow's Keras interface to assess the Lewis signalling game as a model of the minimal conditions for the evolution of meaning. <br>
The Lewis signalling game is played by two players: a sender and a receiver. Each round, the sender observes some state of the world, and must choose which of a finite list of messages to send. Upon receiving the message, the receiver must pick from a finite list of actions. Depending on the state of the world and the action chosen, the players receive rewards (or punishments). The simplest version of this game, called the "basic cooperative" Lewis signalling game, features two states, two messages, and two actions, where both players receive rewards when the state and action chosen correspond.
