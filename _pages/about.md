# Welcome! My name is Eli Sandler. 

I'm a candidate for bachelor's degrees in data science and philosophy at Northeastern University. My niches are in machine learning and descriptive ethics, and I hope to one day work in predictive analytics. I like to contribute to data science projects by approaching them in an epistemological manner: what can we know about the subject at hand? What should we believe? How does that effect the conclusions we draw from our analysis? I believe that there's more of an overlap between philosophy and science than is commonly thought, and those connections can be invaluable. 

This site contains some of my recent projects in data science and philosophy. Please feel free to reach out to me via email; I'm generally quick to respond, even outside of typical work hours.
