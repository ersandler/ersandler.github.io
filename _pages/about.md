# Welcome! My name is Eli Sandler. 

I am a candidate for a bachelorâ€™s degree in data science and philosophy at Northeastern University. I study and research machine learning, game theory, network science, and descriptive ethics, and I hope to one day work in predictive analytics. I like to approach data science projects in an epistemological way, by asking: what can we know about the matter at hand? What should we believe based on the evidence? What does that imply for the conclusions we should draw from our analysis? I believe that there is more of an overlap between philosophy and data science than is commonly thought, and that making those connections can be invaluable.

In my first three years at Northeastern, I have studied abroad in London, won an award to support my research projects, and worked as a research assistant and teaching assistant for Northeastern professors. This site contains some of my recent projects in data science and philosophy. I've also spent four months working a co-op at a lab in Northeastern's Portland, ME satellite campus. Please feel free to reach out to me via email. I am always excited to talk about past and future projects, as well as data science and/or philosophy.
