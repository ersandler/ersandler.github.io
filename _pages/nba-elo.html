    As awesome as colorful graphs are, why did I make them?
    I started playing chess seriously at the beginning of the COVID lockdown. I find chess fascinating, mostly for the usual reasons, but also because of the grip that one algorithm has over millions of people. The Elo algorithm is what's used to compute the relative scores of chess players. You get points depending on the expected value of your match, where 0 is a loss, 1 is a win, and .5 is a tie. The difference between expected and actual outcome is then used to alter your Elo score, so it goes up if you, and down if you lose. Both over the board and online, there's a complete obsession in chess with quality of results: as long as you win, it doesn't matter how. You get your Elo points regardless. What if we applied this metric to basketball? What if we don't care about injuries, or margin of victory?<br><br>
Through the end of the 2022-23 NBA season, FiveThirtyEight published their <a href=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2023-nba-predictions/>NBA predictions</a>, which were based on a mixture of advanced basketball statistics and Elo score. I'm using their work as inspiration for my own project. The goal is to produce accurate, insightful ratings for players and teams that are easy to compare and visualize, especially for people unfamiliar with statistics. The code for this project, which is still ongoing, is available in <a href=https://github.com/ersandler/nba-elo>this GitHub repository</a>.<br><br>
