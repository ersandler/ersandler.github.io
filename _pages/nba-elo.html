    I started playing chess seriously at the beginning lockdown. I find it fascinating, mostly the usual reasons, but also because of the grip that this one algorithm has over millions of people. Both over the board and online, there's a complete obsession in chess with quality of results: as long as you win, it doesn't matter how. You get your Elo points regardless. What if we applied this metric to basketball? What if we don't care about injuries, or margin of victory?<br>
    Through the end of the 2022-23 NBA season, FiveThirtyEight published their NBA predictions, which were based off a mixture of advanced basketball statistics and Elo score. I'm using their work as inspiration for my own project, where I attempt a similar process. The goal is to produce accurate, insightful ratings for players and teams that are easy to compare and visualize. The code for this project, which is still ongoing, is available in this GitHub repository.
