      Outside of education, I have a wide variety of interests and hobbies, which I'm very passionate about. I'm a massive Arsenal fan, and also support Williams F1, Indiana University basketball, and the Boston Celtics. I play chess, both online and over the board, and particularly enjoy playing tactical open positions. I love hiking and the outdoors, and one of my biggest goals for the next year is to spend more time outside, in nature, in the mountains. I'm an avid reader, especially of well-written and intricate fantasy. I also have an inexplicable fascination with urban planning, which manifests in my unconditional hatred of cloverleaf interchanges.
